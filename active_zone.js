  VIDA is a simple library that adds camera (or video) based motion detection
  and blob tracking functionality to p5js.

  The library allows motion detection based on a static or progressive
  background; defining rectangular zones in the monitored image, inside which
  the occurrence of motion triggers the reaction of the program; detection of
  moving objects ("blobs") with unique index, position, mass, rectangle,
  approximated polygon.

  The main guidelines of the library are to maintain the code in a compact
  form, easy to modify, hack and rework.

  VIDA is a part of the Tetoki! project (https://tetoki.eu) and is developed
  thanks to substantial help and cooperation with the WRO Art Center
  (https://wrocenter.pl) and HAT Research Center
  (http://artandsciencestudies.com).

  Notes:

    [1] Limitations: of course, the use of the camera from within web browser
    is subject to various restrictions mainly related to security settings (in
    particular, browsers differ significantly in terms of enabling access to
    the video camera for webpages (eg p5js sketches) loaded from local media or
    from the network - in the last case it is also important if the connection
    uses the HTTPS protocol [or HTTP]). Therefore, if there are problems with
    access to the video camera from within a web browser, it is worth testing a
    different one. During developement, for on-the-fly checks, VIDA is mainly
    tested with Firefox, which by default allows you to access the video camera
    from files loaded from local media. VIDA itself does not impose any
    additional specific restrictions related to the type and parameters of the
    camera - any video camera working with p5js should work with the library.
    You can find valuable information on this topic at https://webrtc.org and
    in the documentation of the web browser you use.
    
    [2] Also it is worth remembering that blob detection is rather expensive
    computationally, so it's worth to stick to the lowest possible video
    resolutions if you plan to run your programs on the hardware, the
    performance you are not sure. The efficiency in processing video from a
    video camera and video files should be similar.

    [3] VIDA is using (with a few exceptions) normalized coords instead of
    pixel-based. Thus, the coordinates of the active zones, the location of
    detected moving objects (and some of their other parameters) are
    represented by floating point numbers within the range from 0.0 to 1.0. The
    use of normalized coordinates and parameters allows to manipulate the
    resolution of the image being processed (eg from a video camera) without
    having to change eg the position of active zones. analogously, data
    describing moving objects is easier to use, if their values are not related
    to any specific resolution expressed in pixels. Names of all normalized
    parameters are preceded by the prefix "norm". The upper left corner of the
    image has the coordinates [0.0, 0.0]. The bottom right corner of the image
    has the coordinates [1.0, 1.0].

    parameters if you want to move the zone or change it's size;

    zone without deleting it, this flag will definitely be useful to you; if
    it's value is "true", the zone will be tested, if the variable value is
    "false", the zone will not be tested;

    is detected within the zone; otherwise, the flag value will be "false";

    isMovementDetectedFlag) of the zone has changed in the current frame;
    otherwise, the flag value will be "false";
      changedTime, changedFrameCount - the moment - expressed in milliseconds

    isMovementDetectedFlag);
      normFillFactor - ratio of the area of the zone in which movement was
    detected to the whole surface of the zone
      normFillThreshold - ratio of the area of the zone in which movement
    was detected to the total area of the zone required to be considered that

    opposed to function
    [your vida object].setActiveZonesNormFillThreshold(normVal);
